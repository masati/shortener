## Task
Create simple "URL shortener" PHP web application.

## Details of task
<p>The main (perhaps only) page would be simple form, where you put in the complete URL, and after submitting the website will give you shortlink URL.</p> 
<p>Then, if you use this short URL, you will be redirected to the original long URL For example, when I put in address "https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-resolvers-performance-compared-cloudflare-x-google-x-quad9-x-opendns-149e803734e5" and it will give me URL "http://localhost/d8aj4s" When i open another tab and put in URL "http://localhost/d8aj4s", i should be redirected to URL "https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-resolvers-performance-compared-cloudflare-x-google-x-quad9-x-opendns-149e803734e5" Store data in SQL database. </p>
<p>Use your favorite PHP framework. The app needs to be ready for production (reasonably optimized, safe) The output is zipped source code with installation instructions (including SQL script for creating database schema)</p>

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
